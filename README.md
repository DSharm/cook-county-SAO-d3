# Cook County SAO Interactive Visualization 
The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) is the second largest prosecutor’s office in the United States. Tens of thousands of criminal cases are prosecuted every year by the Office, across 100 law enforcement jurisdictions and in service of over five million residents of Cook County. When she took office in December 2016, State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced a largely unprecedented commitment to improving the transparency of the SAO’s work. Accordingly, in 2017 the SAO released a Baseline Data Report, along with de-identified data capturing snapshots of all cases that go through the SAO from arrest to sentencing.

The purpose of this dashboard is to allow viewers to explore the SAO datasets - specifically the Intake, Dispositions, and Sentencing Datasets.
